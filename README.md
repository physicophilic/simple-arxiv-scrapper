# (for abstract)|M(ore results)/F(lip sorting)/Q(uit)
```

The output by default is sorted by relevance. Here on 

- `M/m` will give 10 more results
- `F` will flip to top 10 chronological papers satisfying search query
- `#` will give abstract, with author name, journal name, date - see next example

As a starting point in understanding Quantum Mechanics, the postulates of
Quantum Mechanics are presented, and few of the main eigenvalue problems, as
well.
